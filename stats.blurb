Since plain agar failed to produce growth for many treatments
including water, only PDA data are considered.

Looking at water as a base to check for differences between awhetos
and the presence/absence of light, Awheto 4 shows a significant effect
of light (p = 0.02) whereas Awheto 5 does not (p = 0.08).

It's abundantly clear that leaves hinder the growth of either awheto
with only one instance of any growth and that is 80% less than any
other recorded growth for other treatments.

The extent of the hindering ability of other treatments was tested by
comparing the corresponding effects on growth with that of water.

The two awhetos produced differing interactions and so were analysed
separately.  

Awheto 4 exhibited a significant negative effect of light on growth
(0.76mm) and no significant reduced growth for Roots or Soil.
However, with the omission of the single exceptional Soil data point
(twice the growth of most other recorded, and substantially greater
than those for water) the effect of light became insignificant but all
treatments showed significantly less growth (at least 1.4mm) than
water.

Growth of Awheto 5 shows a significant effect of light with Berries
only but that was assumed to be of minimal practical
significance. Omitting the interaction term from the model made the
effect of light overall to be insignificant.  All treatments showed
highly significantly lower (at least 2.25mm) growth than for water.
